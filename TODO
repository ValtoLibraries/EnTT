* custom allocators and EnTT allocator-aware in general (long term feature, I don't actually need it at the moment) - see #22
* to analyze, long term feature: systems organizer based on dependency graphs for implicit parallelism (I don't want to think anymore in future :-))
* scene management (I prefer the concept of spaces, that is a kind of scene anyway)
* blueprint registry - kind of factory to create entitites template for initialization (get rid of the extra versions of Registry::create)
* review doc: separate it in multiple md/dox files, reduce the readme to a minimum and provide users with links to the online documentation on gh-pages
* debugging tools (#60): the issue online already contains interesting tips on this, look at it
* signals on component creation/destruction: crtp + internal detection, probably it works - test it!!
* define a macro for the noexcept policy, so as to provide users with an easy way to disable exception handling
* AOB
